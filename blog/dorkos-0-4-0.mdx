DorkOS 0.4.0 lays the foundation for multi-agent coordination. Agents can now discover each other through Mesh, communicate through Relay, and carry persistent identities — turning DorkOS from a single-agent interface into an agent operating system.

## Highlights

**Relay Message Bus** — A full inter-agent messaging system with delivery tracing, dead-letter handling, and MCP tools. Pulse jobs and console output now route through Relay for unified message delivery. External adapters enable Telegram and webhook channels.

**Mesh Agent Discovery** — Agents register themselves, discover peers, and manage access permissions through a topology graph. ELK.js-powered layout with zoom level-of-detail, health monitoring, and namespace grouping provide full observability into the agent network.

**Agent Identity** — Agents are now first-class entities with persistent identities, personas, and capabilities. Each agent has a `.dork/agent.json` manifest that the SDK context builder injects into system prompts.

covers:
  - 'feat(config): runtimes.dorkosTools experiment leaf (DOR-1613)'
  - 'feat(runtimes): give codex and opencode the DorkOS tools over /mcp (DOR-1613)'
---

### Added

- Your Codex and OpenCode agents can now use the same DorkOS tools your Claude Code agents already have — posting in rooms, reacting with an emoji, reading back what was said, and remembering things between sessions. It is off to start with: turn on **DorkOS tools in every runtime** in Settings under Experiments, and it takes effect on those agents' next turn. Expect their turns to cost a little more, since they now carry a longer list of tools (DOR-1613)

### Fixed

- Fixed the address DorkOS gives Codex for the panel it uses to open things on your screen. It was fixed to one form of "this machine", which is not always the one DorkOS is listening on — so on some Macs, and inside Docker on Windows, Codex could not reach it at all (DOR-723)

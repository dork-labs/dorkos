/**
 * Crash & stall recovery (§12) — the **canonical typed oracle** for the `/flow`
 * engine's durable run record and next-tick recovery ladder.
 *
 * This module is the **pinned oracle** the v1 skill-based runtime is checked
 * against, and the **P5 promotion surface**: when the loop moves server-side
 * (DOR-89), the server imports {@link recoverOrphan} verbatim — the recovery
 * *decision* is a pure function of the durable {@link FlowRun}, the orphan
 * signal, and a small probe context, so it ports from skill to server without a
 * rewrite. Keep it pure: no I/O, no clock, no tracker calls. The runtime gathers
 * facts (does the worktree exist? is the session log intact? is the worker pid
 * alive?), hands them in via {@link RecoveryContext}, and *acts* on the returned
 * {@link RecoveryAction}.
 *
 * ## Sessions are ephemeral; the work is durable
 *
 * The checkpoint is the **git commit + the JSONL session**, not the live agent
 * process. So recovery **resumes** — re-attach the worktree at HEAD and `resume`
 * the captured {@link FlowRun.sessionId} — and **never restarts from scratch**
 * while a usable checkpoint survives. Only when the checkpoint is gone (no
 * worktree, or a corrupt/missing session log) does the ladder fall back to a
 * clean restart. See {@link RecoveryAction}.
 *
 * ## "Parked on a human" is a distinct, never-reclaimed state
 *
 * An item parked on the human (the `agent/needs-input` disposition) is NOT an
 * orphan: it is *waiting by design*, and resumes only when the human replies.
 * The stall sweep **never** reclaims it — see the `needs-input` branch of
 * {@link recoverOrphan}. This is the single most important invariant here.
 *
 * ## v1 vs v2 (what is built here)
 *
 * v1 is **sequential, single-machine, WIP 1**: it needs no heartbeat or lease,
 * because on a fresh tick any `agent/claimed` + In-Progress + not-`needs-input`
 * item is orphaned *by definition* — a {@link FlowRun.workerPid} liveness check
 * suffices. v2 (concurrent) layers on {@link FlowRun.heartbeatAt}, a fencing
 * token, atomic multi-claim, and a stall-detector tick — that is server residue
 * (DOR-89), **NOT built here**. {@link FlowRun.heartbeatAt} is carried as an
 * optional field only, unused by the v1 path.
 *
 * @see specs/unified-workflow-system/02-specification.md §12 (crash & stall recovery)
 * @see ./config-schema.ts ({@link RecoverySchema} — `maxRetries`/`onExhausted`/`staleAfter`)

 *    local {@link FlowRun} (claimed on another machine): reconstruct from tracker
 *    + workspace (tracker-as-truth). `run` is absent for this signal.
 * 3. **Retries exhausted ⇒ `escalate`.** When `run.attemptCount >=
 *    recovery.maxRetries` there is no reclaim left: apply
 *    {@link RECOVERY_BLOCKED_LABEL}, comment, and nudge.
 * 4. **Checkpoint survives ⇒ `resume`** (re-attach worktree at HEAD, `resume`
 *    the session); **else ⇒ `restart-clean`.** Either way `attemptCount` is
 *    incremented by exactly one and returned for the runtime to persist.
 *

 * check has already established the worker is dead.

 * @param signal - The orphan disposition that triggered the sweep.

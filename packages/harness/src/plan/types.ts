 * - `generate`: a wholly-engine-owned file (re)written deterministically.
 * - `merge`: engine-owned entries merged INTO a user-owned file (e.g. plugin
 *   hooks into `.claude/settings.local.json`), touching only the managed keys.
 * - `drop`: no home in the target harness; reported, never written.

## Profile

- **Company size**: 1-10 developers
- **Stage**: Bootstrapped or seed-stage
- **Industry**: Software / SaaS / developer tools / consulting

## Characteristics

- Already paying for Claude Pro/Team or API access
- Multiple active repositories (3-15)
- At least one developer running Claude Code daily
- Uses GitHub, has CI/CD, ships weekly or faster
- Comfortable with self-hosted open source tooling
- Values control over convenience — would rather run their own infra than use a managed service

## Why They Adopt DorkOS

They've hit the ceiling of what isolated agent sessions can do. They want agents to coordinate across their repos, run overnight, and communicate results — without giving up control to a hosted platform.

## Why They Don't Adopt

- If they only use AI agents occasionally (< 5 sessions/week)
- If they prefer managed/hosted solutions over self-hosted
- If they're locked into a competing agent platform with its own orchestration

## Revenue Signals (Future Monetization Context)

- Would pay for a Pro CLI with team features (shared schedules, audit logs)
- Would pay for hosted Relay adapters (managed Slack/Telegram bridges)
- Would NOT pay for the core open source platform itself

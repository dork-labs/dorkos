## Why They're an Anti-Persona

Jordan wants a prettier ChatGPT. They heard "AI agents" are powerful and want one, but they don't use a terminal, don't have a local development environment, and would never run `npm install`. They expect a hosted dashboard, drag-and-drop workflows, and natural language configuration.

DorkOS would frustrate Jordan at every turn: npm install, JSON config, JSONL transcripts, cron expressions, port configuration, Obsidian plugins. The product deliberately does not accommodate this user, and attempting to would compromise the developer-first design.

## What Jordan Wants That DorkOS Will Never Provide

- A hosted, no-install web app
- Visual workflow builders instead of config files
- Plain English instead of cron syntax
- No terminal required at any step
- Customer support

## Quote

"I just want to tell the AI what to do and have it happen. Why do I need to install anything?"

## Value of This Anti-Persona

When feature requests arrive for "simpler onboarding" or "no-code configuration", this persona is the filter. If the request would primarily serve Jordan, it's out of scope. DorkOS is infrastructure for developers, not a consumer product.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or later
- npm 10 or later
- A Claude API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

## Install

Install DorkOS globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g dorkos
```

## Set Your API Key

DorkOS needs your Anthropic API key to communicate with Claude:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

To persist this, add it to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

## Start DorkOS

```bash
dorkos
```

The server starts on port 4242 and opens your browser automatically.

## Verify

Visit [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242) to see the DorkOS interface.

# Keyboard Shortcuts

DorkOS supports keyboard shortcuts to help you respond to Claude's requests without reaching for the mouse. When Claude needs your approval or input, you can use these shortcuts to interact quickly.

## Navigation Shortcuts

These shortcuts work at any time, regardless of what Claude is doing.

<TypeTable
  type={{
    '⌘B / Ctrl+B': {
      description: 'Toggle the sidebar open or closed.',
      type: 'key',
    },
  }}
/>

## When Shortcuts Work

Keyboard shortcuts activate automatically when Claude pauses to ask for your approval or answer. You'll see visual indicators (amber borders and key hints) on the active request.

<Callout type="info">
Shortcuts are only available on desktop (screens 768px and wider). On mobile devices, use the on-screen buttons.
</Callout>

## Tool Approval Shortcuts

When Claude asks to approve a tool (like running a command or accessing a file):

<TypeTable
  type={{
    Enter: {
      description: 'Approve the tool call.',
      type: 'key',
    },
    Escape: {
      description: 'Deny the tool call.',
      type: 'key',
    },
  }}
/>

## Question Response Shortcuts

When Claude asks you a question with multiple options:

### Selecting Options

<TypeTable
  type={{
    '1 - 9': {
      description: 'Toggle the option at that position (1 is first, 2 is second, etc.).',
      type: 'key',
    },
    '↑ Arrow Up': {
      description: 'Move focus to the previous option.',
      type: 'key',
    },
    '↓ Arrow Down': {
      description: 'Move focus to the next option.',
      type: 'key',
    },
    Space: {
      description: 'Toggle the currently focused option.',
      type: 'key',
    },
    Enter: {
      description: 'Submit your answer(s).',
      type: 'key',
    },
  }}
/>

### Navigating Between Questions

When Claude asks multiple questions at once:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    '← Arrow Left or [': {
      description: 'Go to the previous question.',
      type: 'key',
    },
    '→ Arrow Right or ]': {
      description: 'Go to the next question.',
      type: 'key',
    },
  }}
/>

### Free-Text Responses

If you select "Other" to provide a custom answer, most shortcuts are disabled while you're typing. Only `Enter` remains active to submit your response.

## Visual Indicators

When shortcuts are active, you'll see:

- **Amber border ring** around the active request
- **Key hints** next to buttons showing which keys to press (e.g., `Enter`, `Esc`, `1`, `2`)
- **Highlighted option** when using arrow keys to navigate

## Multiple Pending Requests

If Claude asks for multiple approvals or answers at once, only the first pending request responds to keyboard shortcuts. After you resolve it, the next request automatically becomes active.

## Chat Input

When you're typing a message in the chat input, all shortcuts are disabled so you can type freely. Shortcuts only activate when Claude is waiting for your approval or answer.

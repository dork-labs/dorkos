# Tool Approval

DorkOS gives you control over what actions Claude can take during a conversation. When tool approval is enabled, Claude will pause and ask for your permission before running certain operations.

## What is Tool Approval?

Tool approval is a safety feature that lets you review and approve (or deny) actions before Claude executes them. When Claude wants to use a tool — like reading a file, running a command, or modifying code — DorkOS will show you what Claude is planning to do and wait for your decision.

## How It Works

### Approving Tools

When Claude needs to use a tool, you'll see a tool approval card appear in the chat. This card shows:

- **Tool name** — The specific operation Claude wants to perform
- **Tool input** — The parameters or arguments for the tool (like file paths, search terms, or command arguments)
- **Approve and Deny buttons** — Your decision controls

To approve the tool:
1. Review the tool name and input to understand what Claude is about to do
2. Click the **Approve** button to allow the action
3. Claude will execute the tool and continue with your task

### Denying Tools

If you don't want Claude to perform a specific action:
1. Click the **Deny** button to reject the tool call
2. Claude will receive a denial message and choose a different approach
3. You can explain in your next message why you denied the action, or ask Claude to try something else

### Approval Timeout

Tool approvals have a 10-minute timeout. If you don't respond within 10 minutes, the tool call is automatically denied and Claude will continue with a different approach. This prevents sessions from hanging indefinitely while waiting for approval.

## Question Prompts

Some tools need more than just approval — they need answers from you. When Claude uses the `AskUserQuestion` tool, you'll see an interactive question prompt instead of a simple approve/deny choice.

### Answering Questions

Question prompts show:
- **The question** — What Claude needs to know
- **Answer options** — Pre-defined choices you can select
- **Other option** — A free-text field if none of the options fit

Types of questions:
- **Single-select questions** — Choose one option from a list (radio buttons)
- **Multi-select questions** — Choose multiple options (checkboxes)

To respond:
1. Read the question carefully
2. Select one or more options (depending on the question type)
3. Or enter your own answer in the "Other" field
4. Click **Submit** to send your answers back to Claude

Your answers are injected into the tool's input, and Claude continues with your selections incorporated into its reasoning.

## Permission Modes

DorkOS supports different permission modes that control when tool approval is required:

- **Default mode** — Every tool call requires approval (maximum control)
- **Auto-approve mode** — Tools run automatically without approval (faster, less control)

The permission mode is set when you start a new session. You can see the current mode in the session info.

## Tips for Using Tool Approval

**Review carefully**: Tool inputs can be long or complex. Take time to read through the parameters to understand exactly what Claude is doing.

**Deny when uncertain**: If you're not sure what a tool does or why Claude wants to use it, it's safer to deny and ask Claude to explain.

**Context matters**: Sometimes Claude will explain why it needs a tool before asking for approval. Read the full assistant message to understand the context.

**Question prompts are flexible**: When presented with options, you can always choose "Other" and provide a custom answer if the pre-defined choices don't match your needs.

## Common Scenarios

### File Operations
When Claude wants to read, write, or modify files, you'll see tool calls like:
- `Read` — Reading file contents
- `Write` — Creating or overwriting a file
- `Edit` — Making specific edits to an existing file

Review the file paths carefully to ensure Claude is working with the right files.

### Search Operations
Tools like `Grep` and `Glob` search for files or content. Check the search patterns to make sure Claude is searching in the right places.

### Command Execution
The `Bash` tool runs terminal commands. Always review the command to ensure it's safe and does what you expect.

### Web Access
Tools like `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` access the internet. Review the URLs or search queries to ensure they're appropriate.

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about a tool call:
- Deny the action and ask Claude to explain what it's trying to do
- Request that Claude use a different approach
- Ask Claude to break down the task into smaller, clearer steps

Tool approval gives you full transparency and control over Claude's actions. Use it to stay informed and keep your sessions safe.
